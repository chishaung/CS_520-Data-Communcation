\paragraph{
In this project, I am going to study Dedicated Short Range Communication (DSRC) in Wireless Access in Vehicular Environment Systems (WAVE). According to some research articles, much of them denotes that Transportation Safety is one of the most important Intelligence Transportation System (ITS) application[1], so its reliability may be a critical issue for an ideal system. The goal of this paper, will shows my understanding of the DSRC, WAVE and how does it applies to current ITS, and more, what is the major critical issues of it.}

\paragraph{
This paper will also be able to show some research for the old DSRC issues, something like: where or which countries first use this technique? what were the problems they met? what situation may be happened between data communications? What is the maximum distance for DSRC? what is the maximum speed is acceptable? The fault toleration and its stability.  And the paper should also shows how is the solution made before, and what are the difficult for the current ITS.}
